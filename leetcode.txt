// Calculate the remainder when num is divided by k
// The formula(((num % k) + k) % k) ensures that the remainder is non-negative


// Formulae to update Indexes in circular data structures is:
// front = (front - 1 + K) % K; (K: Size of the DataStructure)
// back = (back + 1) % K; (K: Size of the DataStructure)


If we are asked All possible permutation / combination / subsets means backtracking
backtracking is 
1. do something
2. explore
3. revert step 1 and further explore


deque front and back operation in O(1) Time


stringStream method similar to Cin>> 

In interval based problems .. if not sorted Try ki sort karlo before solving based on starting or ending or both 

Expression evaluate / parenthesis always use stack

If we are exploring options means different flows / paths means there is Recursion

All possible substring subsets etc ... Backtracking

Backtracking = 1.Do 2.Explore 3.Undo

Number of Bits to represent a Number : Floor of Log2(N) + 1

All bitwise operations, like XOR, AND, and OR, operate directly on the binary representations of numbers
