// Calculate the remainder when num is divided by k
// The formula(((num % k) + k) % k) ensures that the remainder is non-negative


// Formulae to update Indexes in circular data structures is:
// front = (front - 1 + K) % K; (K: Size of the DataStructure)
// back = (back + 1) % K; (K: Size of the DataStructure)


If we are asked All possible permutation / combination / subsets means backtracking
backtracking is 
1. do something
2. explore
3. revert step 1 and further explore


deque front and back operation in O(1) Time
